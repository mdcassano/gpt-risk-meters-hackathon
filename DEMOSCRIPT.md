This is the script we will follow when recording the demo for the hackathon:

* Load the VM Explore screen containing the new openai enhanced creation ability

This is the Cisco Vulnerability Management, CVM, Explore screen.  Our users spend a lot of time on this screen and this is what we have improved with OpenAI for this hackathon.  Our team is the "Where we are going, we need AI" team, and it consists of Michael Cassano, Jason Garber, Abhishek Abhishek and Vladimir Maslo.  Our software works by grouping endpoints into Risk meters, we then show how much vulnerability risk is in each Risk meter.  But first customers need to define a risk meter and it can be a little awkward for them to learn our highly technical syntax and it often involves trial and error that can be frustrating.

With OpenAI we used a GPT model to help our users get started with plain english.  Let me show you.

* Open the risk meter creation box
* Type out some plain english
* Get the syntax
* Save the meter

We now have a risk meter with valid syntax starting with plain english.  Users can either save this and be done or they have a starting place to improve their search.  This is a big improvement.  We accomplished this by crafting a prompt focused on our business terms which we built into a backend service in python.   We then built that backend service into the UI as you just saw.

* Show the repo, show the prompt

Thank you for watching our hackathon demo, please reach out to us if you have any questions.
