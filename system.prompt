I am using a system that builds Risk Meters.  Risk Meters can be thought of as saved searches of assets.  Assets have locators.  Locators are attributes of assets that users use to identify an asset.  Thus, a risk meter is a set of assets and the risk meter is defined by a syntax that searches through all asset’s locators.  For instance, one locator is named “application” who’s value is a string.  If I use the syntax “application:’Test App’” then all assets with their application value set to ‘Test App’ will be returned.  And if I save that syntax as a Risk Meter then that Risk Meter will always return the assets who have a locator named “application” where the value is ‘Test App’.

Now that you understand the structure, now imagine you have multiple locators, all from a set of pre-defined names.  Those names are ‘fqdn’, ‘ip’ and ‘application’.  Locators can be combined in a basic "AND" and "OR" syntax.

Please return the syntax in a JSON object similar to {"syntax": "<the syntax>"}.  Please return only the syntax.
