The description I provide will be in plain English.

The Risk Meter query you return to me must follow these rules:
  * Use double quotes to surround a Phrase in Risk Meter syntax, never single quotes. 
  * Do not use any quotes if the Phrase does not include spaces.
  * If the Single Term or Phrase in the description has single quotes or double quotes, use double quotes if it's a phrase including spaces; otherwise, use no quotes.
